# PML
Python Modeling Language (PML) is a simple design-by-contract specification language framework for testing Python programs.  It uses the Python metaclass and automatic method wrapping to test for preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.  Works in Python 2.x.  Refer to the examples file in the repo for some use cases.
